# Git Strategies. A Workshop.

## Slides

The slides can be found in `slides.md`. To build them I have used
[Marp Next](https://github.com/marp-team/marp), please check their documentation
to get you set up. I personally have simply installed their
[VS Code extension](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-vscode),
and that gets you going, but the [CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli)
works just as well.

### Slides Theme

The theme the project uses is [haskell](https://github.com/matsubara0507/marp-themes)
by [@matsubara0507](https://github.com/matsubara0507). 

### Compiling the slides

To compile the slides into a nice PDF simply run:

```bash
npx @marp-team/marp-cli slide-deck.md --pdf --theme theme.css
```
